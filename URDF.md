# Unified Robot Description Format (URDF)

URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) is used in ROS2 to represent the structure and components of a robot in XML format. It defines how different parts of the robot are organized, how they are connected, and their properties. URDF is essential for simulating robot behavior, particularly when using a physics engine to model interactions with the environment.

## Key Components of URDF

The URDF consists of several XML tags that define the robotâ€™s components and their relationships. Below is an example illustrating the main URDF tags:

```xml
<robot>
    <link>
        <name></name>
        <visual>
          <geometry></geometry>
        </visual>
        <collision>
          <geometry></geometry>
        </collision>
        <inertial>
          <mass />
          <inertia />
        </inertial>
    </link>

    <joint>
        <type></type>
        <parent></parent>
        <child></child>
        <origin></origin>
        <limit></limit>
        <axis></axis>
    </joint>
</robot>
```

### 1. `<robot>`
- This is the root element that defines the structure of the robot. It acts as a container for all the components (links and joints) and specifies how they are connected within the robot model.

### 2. `<link>`
- A **link** represents a component or part of the robot, such as a limb, body part, or sensor. It creates a reference frame and can include several sub-tags to define its properties:
  - **`<name>`**: A unique identifier for the link.
  - **`<visual>`**: Specifies the appearance of the link, including a 3D model or mesh, which is useful for visualization purposes.
  - **`<collision>`**: Defines the physical volume of the link, typically used for collision detection in simulations.
  - **`<inertial>`**: Defines the inertia properties of the link (mass, center of mass, and moments of inertia), important for physics simulations. These parameters help the physics engine understand how the body will move under external forces.
    - **`<mass>`**: Specifies the mass of the link in kilograms (kg). This is essential for calculating how the link responds to forces in simulations (e.g., gravity or applied forces).
    - **`<inertia>`**: Defines the inertia tensor of the link, which helps simulate how the link resists rotational acceleration. The inertia tag typically contains three values:
      - **`ixx`, `iyy`, `izz`**: These represent the moments of inertia about the X, Y, and Z axes respectively.
      - **`ixy`, `ixz`, `iyz`**: These represent the products of inertia, which are important for understanding how the link's mass is distributed relative to its rotation.

    The `<inertial>` tag is crucial for accurate physical simulation, particularly when the robot is interacting with forces and needs realistic motion (such as rotation or sliding).

### 3. `<joint>`
- A **joint** connects two links and defines the relationship between them. Joints allow for movement or fixed connections between parts of the robot. The joint element includes:
  - **`<parent>`** and **`<child>`**: Define which two links are connected. The **parent** link is the reference, and the **child** link is attached to it.
  - **`<type>`**: Specifies the type of joint, e.g., fixed, revolute (rotational), prismatic (translational), etc. This defines how the two connected links move relative to each other.
  - **`<origin>`**: Defines the position and orientation of the joint in relation to the parent link. The `<origin>` tag is usually specified with attributes like **`xyz`** for position and **`rpy`** for roll, pitch, and yaw.
  - **`<limit>`**: Specifies limits on the relative movement of the links connected by the joint (e.g., maximum angle or distance). This is useful for limiting the range of motion of a joint to avoid unrealistic or unsafe behavior.
  - **`<axis>`**: Defines the axis of rotation or translation for the joint (for revolute or prismatic joints). This tag is important for determining the direction of movement.

The joint structure follows a tree-like hierarchy:
- Each link can have one parent link, but a parent can have multiple child links connected to it. This creates the robot's kinematic chain.

### 4. `<visual>` and `<geometry>`

#### `<visual>`
- The **visual** tag is used to describe the **appearance** of the link, which is useful for visualization tools like RViz. It contains the **geometry** tag and may also include material properties (though materials are usually specified separately in other contexts). 
  - The **`<geometry>`** tag defines the 3D shape of the link. It can include primitive shapes such as:
    - **`box`**
    - **`cylinder`**
    - **`sphere`**
    - **`mesh`**: For more complex shapes, a 3D mesh file (e.g., `.stl` or `.dae`) can be used.
    
    Example:
    ```xml
    <geometry>
        <box size="0.1 0.1 0.1"/>
    </geometry>
    ```

  - This tag does not affect physics directly but is used in visualization for graphical representation.

#### `<collision>`
- The **collision** tag is similar to the **visual** tag but serves a different purpose. It defines the **physical properties** of the link as used for collision detection in the physics engine. While it typically also uses the **`<geometry>`** tag, the shape and properties here might be simplified or approximate, as the primary goal is to ensure accurate and efficient collision calculations.

    Example:
    ```xml
    <geometry>
        <cylinder radius="0.05" length="0.1"/>
    </geometry>
    ```

  The **collision geometry** is generally a simplified version of the **visual geometry** to reduce computational overhead during collision checks.

### 5. `<inertial>` - Mass and Inertia

- **`<mass>`**: This tag defines the **mass** of the link. It plays a vital role in how the link behaves under external forces, especially in simulations involving gravity, torque, or external impacts. The mass is defined in kilograms (kg), and it directly affects the force calculations in physics simulations.
  
  Example:
  ```xml
  <mass value="1.0"/>
  ```

- **`<inertia>`**: This tag specifies the **inertia tensor** for the link. The inertia tensor is crucial for understanding how the link resists changes in its rotational motion (i.e., how easily it accelerates or decelerates when subjected to torque). The inertia is usually specified with values such as **`ixx`**, **`iyy`**, and **`izz`** (diagonal moments of inertia), along with **`ixy`**, **`ixz`**, and **`iyz`** (products of inertia).

  Example:
  ```xml
  <inertia ixx="0.01" iyy="0.01" izz="0.01" ixy="0.0" ixz="0.0" iyz="0.0"/>
  ```

The **inertia** is essential for accurate physics simulations, particularly when modeling how the robot reacts to forces, rotations, and torques.

## How URDF Works

By reusing these tags for different components (links and joints), and specifying their properties and relationships, you can build a complete model of your robot. This model can then be used for tasks like simulation, control, and visualization. URDF provides the foundation for describing both simple and complex robots, from stationary arms to mobile robots with multiple degrees of freedom.

### Summary of Key URDF Tags:
- **`<link>`**: Represents a physical part of the robot.
- **`<geometry>`**: Defines the shape of the link for visual and collision purposes.
- **`<inertial>`**: Specifies mass and inertia for realistic physics simulations.
- **`<joint>`**: Defines the relationship and movement between links.
- **`<visual>`**: Defines the appearance of the link (for visualization).
